# Process

### Introduction

The intention is to use this bench project as an opportunity to practice the [Scott Logic Way of Working](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fayal88Yw_pomILOASbtkXKBU5jn0dWqgdt_66QEGgk/edit#).

### Information sharing

The intention is to allow maximum visibility of information to allow easy working with anyone interested in the work.

GitHub is intended to be the main source of information, with a [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1i53MXJarc_LQ2-eZptTCA1cNB-CLBf_b) being used for anything that might not fit with GitHub, for example [meeting notes](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1w9qL2Z3M5nyz35MHKUfA-PyUWJieK404).  The Google Drive is set to be editable by anyone at Scott Logic.

Documents like this page are written as [GitHub Markdown files](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) so that information can be kept in one place, and are searchable (the GitHub Wiki is not searchable).

### Methodology

When thinking about process we look to [Scrum](https://www.scrumguides.org/docs/scrumguide/v2017/2017-Scrum-Guide-US.pdf#zoom=100) as a starting point.

We use 1 week Sprints as a way to regularly review our output and check that the work continues to be valuable to Scott Logic.

The [Kanban board](https://github.com/ScottLogic/natwest-reconciliation/projects/1) is used to prioritise the product backlog, plan a Sprint, highlight the work in progress and review the status at the end of a Sprint.
